## Evil Hangman

Evil Hangman is a game of hangman in which the computer "cheats" to prevent the player from winning. This was a simple class project for CSIS 10B and will not see any active development.

The computer makes use of a large word list that it filters in to classes based on the players input. As the player guesses letters, the computer creates classes based on the particular position(s) in wich the letter could fall in the word and groups words with letters in the same position(s) in to a singular class. Words with zero occurences of the user input are also a class. The computer then selects the class with the greatest size and uses that as it's updated word pool. If selected class contains the input at some position, then the computer awards that guess to the player, otherwise the player is exhausts one of their allowed incorrect guesses and the game continues. Once the player has exhausted all of their guesses the computer selects a random word from the remaining word pool to be the word that it "selected"
